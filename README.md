From 2020 to 2022, X-Mart operated in a highly competitive electronics market. To grow sustainably and profitably, the company needed to understand which categories, brands, and regions were driving results‚Äîand which weren‚Äôt. This dashboard was built to empower leadership with the right insights by combining product category trends, brand preferences, geographic performance, and financial summaries.

It tells a clear story:

"Where are we making money, which products are thriving, and which markets and brands need attention?"

# Key Business Problem:

The main business problem was:

‚ÄúDespite healthy sales, profit margins seemed stagnant across years, and decision-makers lacked clarity on which product lines or regions were underperforming or over-performing.‚Äù

Specific concerns included:

- **Are we investing in the right product categories?**

- **Which supervisors or regions are outperforming others?**

- **Which brands are contributing most to sales?**

- **How can we optimize our cost-to-sales ratio?**

# üí° Insights Extracted from the Dashboard:

1. Category Performance (Top Center Bar Chart):

- **Monitors, Mouse, and CPU are the top 3 categories in terms of quantity and sales, with Monitors leading at 1843 units.**

- **Lower-performing categories include Printer, NIC, and Computer Case, which might be considered for product line reviews or phase-outs.**

Insight: Focus marketing and inventory efforts on high-performing categories while reviewing the profitability of low-selling items.

2. Geographic Trends (Map - Bottom Left):

- **Sales are concentrated in South India, Maharashtra, and Delhi NCR.**

- **Some regions appear to have low or no sales activity, possibly indicating untapped markets or poor coverage.**

Insight: There‚Äôs an opportunity to expand presence in low-activity states while investing more in the regions showing high potential.

3. Brand Contribution (Pie Chart - Bottom Right):

- **Intel (19%), Samsung (16%), and Dell (14%) lead in brand-based sales.**

- **Brands like Seagate (3%) and Hynix (5%) contribute the least.**

Insight: Sales campaigns and supplier negotiations should prioritize Intel, Samsung, and Dell. Underperforming brands need assessment for strategic fit or replacement.

4. Key Metrics (Right Sidebar):

- **Total Sales: 99M**

- **Total Cost: 76M **

- **Total Quantity Sold: 13K**

- **Transactions: 5095**

- **Profit: 23M**

Insight: A healthy profit margin of approx. 23% indicates good pricing control but also suggests potential to improve it by managing cost-heavy items.

5. Supervisor Performance (Left Panel):
Although individual metrics per supervisor are not visualized in detail, this setup implies potential for drilling down by supervisor, helping assess who needs support or training.

Insight: Future versions could benefit from per-supervisor KPIs (e.g., sales volume, region, returns).

# In Nutshell :

Our dashboard reveals that while total sales and profits are strong, there is a concentration in specific product categories, regions, and brands. By reallocating efforts toward high-performing segments and reevaluating underperforming ones, we can drive better growth and profitability in the next fiscal cycle.
